# JavaScript as a backend exercises

- [x] Create a node server that can handle GET requests to three endpoints eg. eg. /cats /dogs /unicorns, returning a different set of data from each
- [x] Create a website with three buttons
- [x] Connect your front end and your backend - each button should retrieve the data from a different endpoint and display it. Use fetch eg. fetch('http://localhost:3000/cats). You will probably get 'CORS' errors here so check out the demo code for ideas on how to resolve that! Hint: You'll need to set some headers for Access Control!
